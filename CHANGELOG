	+ Fixed a bug that caused ft6 to crash in some cases while performing the ICMPv6 Filtering test
	+ Added a "demo mode": you can start it with "./client.py --demo". No packets will be sent but ft6 will still
	  display some results (these are the results I get in my lab using iptables). 
      With the demo mode, you can easily showcase ft6 without the need to bring a server and a firewall.
	+ Added a configuration: when you start a new session your settings are saved to ft6.conf so that they can
	  be reused the next time you run ft6. This allows you to test the same device multiple times without having
	  to enter addresses and ports every time.

	+ Added copyright and licensing information
	+ moved the tiny fragments timeout to a separate test
	+ the tiny fragments timeout test will now only be called if tiny fragments can traverse the firewall
	  this is being discovered in the "normal" tiny fragments test
	+ changed the statuses (stati??) of the icmp tests for the non-filtered tests:
		cisco asa won't forward messages like "message too big" if the server doesn't actually send a packet that
		is too big.. so it's more stateful that we'd imagined.
		we don't send packets that are too big right now, so if the server doesn't receive the "icmp warning packet too big"
		it doesn't neccessarily mean that it was wrongly dropped.. Ugh, if you read this until here you notice that 
		these kinds of tests are hard to right... so for all these cases the states are now "WARNING"
	+ changed the statuses for routing header tests. This was basically done for the same reasons.
		With these changes we want to reflect that the firewall dropping a valid routing header is BETTER than 
		the firewall forwarding an invalid one.
	+ It is no longer neccessary to specify the link local addresses of client and server, these are now determined
		automagically!
